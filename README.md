I merged this into my existing [lab-assay-lims project](https://github.com/jackaI1/lab-assay-lims/tree/main/projects/microbiome-qc-report). The current code is in `projects/microbiome-qc-report/` there. I kept the code here so older links still work.

The move keeps the original layout, including `tests/test_report.py`, `tests/test_analysis.R`, `tests/test_prepare.py`, `tests/check_run.py`. I replaced the README with the report below and left out Git history, installed dependencies, caches and generated build output from the hub copy.

The 4 test source files moved with the code. No project-specific GitHub Actions workflow was retained; the report records the omitted checks, and the test sources can be run locally from the linked folder.

Other specific omissions: reports/ (generated output).

Omitted workflows: `microbiome-qc-report-ci.yml`: The relocated workflow failed in GitHub Actions and was removed to keep the hub checks independent. Local test sources remain available.

# microbiome-qc-report

I built a bacterial DNA quality report to learn how the underlying idea works. This is a learning project.

## Run it myself

I use [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) to install the pinned environment. On Linux:

```sh
micromamba create -y -n microbiome-qc -f environment-linux-64.lock
micromamba activate microbiome-qc
make demo
```

On an Apple Silicon Mac, use `environment-osx-arm64.lock` in the first command. Other platforms can solve `environment.yml`, but those are not the exact tested package builds. The environment includes R, Python and the analysis packages; `make` is supplied by the operating system's development tools.

`make demo` downloads and verifies the public inputs, keeps a small matching subset of each read pair and writes `results/demo/report.html` and `results/demo/report.md`. Internet access is needed for the initial read and reference downloads. Use a fresh output directory for every run:

```sh
make demo PAIRS=20000 DEPTH=5000 OUT=results/larger-subset
```

`PAIRS` caps raw pairs per sample in archive order. `DEPTH` is the minimum number of usable pairs required for comparison. Changing either changes the analysis; the report records the actual counts and decisions. I use a fixed seed for the equal-depth subsampling so I can repeat the comparison.

## What is inside

DADA2 learns the sequencing error rates, infers amplicon sequence variants (ASVs, distinct marker-gene sequences), joins overlapping read pairs and removes chimeras, which are artificial mixed sequences. It assigns taxonomy, or organism names, against the full RDP reference database. Uncertain names stay unassigned.

The pipeline then plots rarefaction, which asks how many variants I would see with fewer reads. Samples below the requested depth are excluded. It calculates alpha diversity, the variety within each sample, and beta diversity, differences between samples, at the same read depth. The report includes read survival, quality profiles, fitted error diagnostics, organism names and a distance matrix. The underlying tables and sequence FASTA are saved alongside it.

The blank screen flags variants enriched in the control for manual review. One blank provides limited evidence, and a flag is not proof of contamination. I keep flagged variants visible and do not silently delete them. Missing or empty controls are marked unavailable. See [the analysis choices and limitations](docs/methods.md) before using this on another dataset.

## Public inputs and references

I use SRA study [SRP155048](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP155048): runs [SRR7588938](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR7588938) (D0), [SRR7588942](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR7588942) (D4), [SRR7588945](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR7588945) (D8) and [SRR10898399](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR10898399) (extraction blank). The reads come from the public ENA mirror of the SRA deposit. No data source was replaced with synthetic data.

The saved report uses a technical subset of the real reads and the full taxonomy reference. It is not a reanalysis of every sample in the paper. The offline CI fixture has a smaller, explicitly labelled reference subset; its purpose is to test execution. [Fixture provenance and attribution](tests/fixture/README.md) explain the difference.

## Tests and limits

I kept 4 files of test code and supporting test helpers in this copy. That source count does not establish an execution result. This is a source snapshot, and running it on a new machine may need environment-specific setup.



Generated output omitted from this copy: reports/ (generated output). Regenerate it with the project scripts.

The relocated workflow failed in GitHub Actions and was removed to keep the hub checks independent. Local test sources remain available.

No project-specific GitHub Actions workflow was retained. The local test sources remain in this folder.
